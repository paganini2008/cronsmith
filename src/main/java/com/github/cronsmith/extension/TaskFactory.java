 * Turns a stored row back into a runnable task. There are exactly two kinds: one whose body is a
 * method reached reflectively, and one whose body is an HTTP request. Replace the default to control
 * how each kind finds its body — for instance by resolving a bean from a dependency-injection
 * container, or by dispatching the call to a remote executor.
