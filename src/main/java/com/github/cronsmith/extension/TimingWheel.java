/**
 * 
 * One level of a hierarchical timing wheel, in the shape Kafka's timer uses.
 * 
 * <p>
 * A level is a ring of {@code wheelSize} slots, each covering {@code tickDuration} milliseconds, so
 * the level as a whole spans {@code interval = tickDuration * wheelSize}. An entry due beyond that
 * span goes to an overflow level created on demand, whose own tick is this level's whole interval.
 * With a one second tick and sixty slots the levels cover a minute, an hour, two and a half days,
 * five months and then twenty-four years, which is deeper than any cron expression needs.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Slots are addressed by absolute time rather than by a moving cursor: an entry due at {@code e}
 * always lands in slot {@code (e / tickDuration) % wheelSize}. Nothing has to be re-indexed when the
 * clock moves, and a slot's identity does not depend on how many ticks have been observed, so a
 * skipped tick cannot shift everything by one.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Advancing happens in two passes, and the order matters. {@link #advanceClock(long)} moves every
 * level's clock first; only then does {@link #flushExpired(Consumer)} empty the slots that were
 * crossed. Emptying a level before the levels below it had their clocks moved would make an entry
 * cascading down look overdue by up to a full tick of the level above.
 * 
 * <p>
 * This class is not thread safe. {@link TimingWheelTaskQueue} owns the lock.
